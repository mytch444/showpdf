showpdf
=======

A GTK pdf viewer.

It is a fork of showpdf by https://github.com/jailop that he seem's to have taken down. I thank him for having released the code that he did.

I've added some features. Good scrolling/paging, zooming, page numbers and remembering what page you are on when you close it.
I'll probably add some other stuff, whatever seems interesting. I'd like to be able to search so that might turn up at some point.
